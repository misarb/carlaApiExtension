- Shows method signatures and return types
- Displays access information for properties (read/write)

### Smart Context Detection
- Shows only relevant completions based on context
- Class suggestions when starting a new statement
- Method and property suggestions only for the current class being typed

## Requirements

- Visual Studio Code version 1.94.0 or higher
- Python extension for VS Code
- CARLA Python API installed in your environment (optional)

## Installation

1. Install the extension through VS Code:
   - Open VS Code
   - Go to Extensions (Ctrl+Shift+X)
   - Search for "CARLA API"
   - Click Install

2. Alternatively, download the VSIX file and install manually:
   ```bash
   code --install-extension carlaapi-0.0.1.vsix
   ```

## Usage

The extension activates automatically when editing Python files. Here's how to use the main features:

1. **Class Completion**
   - Start typing a CARLA class name
   - Press Ctrl+Space to see available classes
   
2. **Method and Property Completion**
   - Type a class name followed by a dot (e.g., `Actor.`)
   - Completions will automatically show available methods and properties
   
3. **Signature Help**
   - Type an opening parenthesis after a method name
   - Signature help will show parameter information
   - Use commas to navigate through parameters

## Examples

```python
# The extension will provide completions and documentation
world = client.get_world()  # Shows World class methods
actor = world.spawn_actor()  # Shows spawn_actor parameters
```

## Known Issues

- Method overloads are currently not supported
- Some complex type hints might not be parsed correctly
- Documentation might be incomplete for some CARLA API methods

If you encounter any issues:

1. Ensure you have the latest version of VS Code installed
2. Check that the Python extension is installed and configured
3. Verify that your CARLA Python API is properly installed
4. Try reloading VS Code if completions don't appear
